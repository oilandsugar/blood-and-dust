description:
  "Can you hear it calling you? The sweet voice calling you through the trees, calling you to come and rest. That sweet voiceâ€”it has a way of getting into your head. It knows what would bring your soul to peace. But it wants to devour you, you know. The whole forest wants to devour you. Bliss is a lie, death is not gentle, and the bloody steel jaws await you."
