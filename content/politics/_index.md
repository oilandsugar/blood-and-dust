# We make horror music in a world full of horrors

Overt horrors. The blood on the ground.
Insidious horrors, which can go unnoticed if you don't look closely enough, or if you're not experiencing it firsthand.
Normative horrors, which impose violence and disenfranchisement on people based on gender, sexuality, race, class, and other identity signifiers.
Capitalist horrors, born of a system built on stolen land and maintained through violence, oppression, and control.

Many of these horrors overlap, working in tandem to create and perpetuate wounds as deep as entire lineages, as deep as the soul, personal and collective.

This is why we are committed to fighting normative violence, fascism, colonialism, and white supremacy in all of its forms. To undermine the capitalist structure and its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question the binary. To actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking. To look inside and face these parts of our darkness, personal and collective, and come out of it with more kindness and compassion.

We strive to use our platform to offer connection, solidarity, and support with marginalized folks—people of colour, trans, non-binary, and queer people, disabled folks, women, and people living at the intersections of these identities—and to give back to our communities, local and abroad.

And we remember that this city, Tiohtià:ke, is the traditional and unceded territory of the Kanien'keha:ka (Mohawk) people, a place which has long served as a site of meeting and exchange amongst nations.
