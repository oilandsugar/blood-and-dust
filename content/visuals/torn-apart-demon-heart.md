  "When thoughts are fed to us and left to fester, we forget who we are, and then the heartbroken demon appears. Tried to hold it all down, but now I’m splitting open, letting the air in. Trying to cut out the rot, but it’s already bloated with maggots. Generations and generations of maggots. Anti-love maggots. Maggots that whisper sweet lies that make sense of all this suffering. Maggots that feed on soft vulnerability as soon as they smell it, tearing it open with sadistic tiny teeth. Ruling you from the inside, forever. Their sickness, their children, forever. I feel every bite, but I’m not holding it in anymore. I can’t. So let the entropy take hold. Spread out the decay. Even as dissected particles we can rebel."
